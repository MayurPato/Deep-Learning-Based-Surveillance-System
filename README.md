# Deep Learning Based Surveillance System
Developed a Security System using YOLOv8 to accurately detect individuals entering or exiting the SRU Unit through various entrances using live footage from existing CCTV cameras. Implemented real-time voice alarm on the PC to promptly alert authorities upon entry. Displayed entry and exit numbers on a live footage window and automatically saved entry/exit data as a .txt file at 12 AM everyday.

**Note: In the refinery, YOLOv5 (YOLOv5m variant) was actually used instead of YOLOv8.**
